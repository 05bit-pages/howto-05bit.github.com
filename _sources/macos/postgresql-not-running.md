PostgreSQL is not running
=========================

PostgreSQL is installed but not running. How to start it?

First, just try:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

If it doesn't help, the most probably reason in present `postmaster.pid` file, just remove it:

```bash
rm /usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid
```
